The *Product Information Management* functionality allows you to build a product catalog with the help of the following features:

* [Product Abstraction](docs\scos\user\features\202009.0\product\product-feature-overview\product-overview.md) to distinguish between different product versions, to keep track of their stock, and to provide a better shopping experience to customers.
* [Product Groups](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-groups/product-groups.html) to group products by attributes.
* [Product Relations](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-relations-feature-overview.html) to recommend related products to customers.
* [Product Attributes](docs\scos\user\features\202009.0\product\product-feature-overview\product-overview.md) to manage products, improve search and filtering on the Storefront.
* [Product Lists](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-lists-feature-overview.html) to blacklist or whitelist products for specific companies.

* [Discontinued Products](docs\scos\user\features\202009.0\product\product-feature-overview\discontinued-product-overview.md) to indicate that a product will not be produced or available anymore.
* [Product Bundles](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-bundles-feature-overview.html) to tie individual items together and sell them as a package.
* [Configurable Bundle](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/configurable-bundle-feature-overview.html) to allow your customers to select components of a compound product from a provided list.

* [Product Sets](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/product-sets/product-sets.html) to build a collection of items so customers can buy individual products or all products from a set with one click.
